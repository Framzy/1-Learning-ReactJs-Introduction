# 1-Learning-ReactJs-Introduction

- React uses JSX when creating Components
- JSX (JavaScript XML or JavaScript Syntax Extension) is a combination of JavaScript and XML (HTML) code, where we can easily create Components using XML and JavaScript code in a single file
- JSX was introduced by Facebook in React, but now JSX has been widely adopted by many other JavaScript Frameworks

## Create Project

- To create a React project, we will use Vite as the build tool.
- We can create a React project using several commands.
- To create a React project using JavaScript:

```zsh
npm create vite@latest application-name -- --template react
```

- To create a React project using TypeScript:

```zsh
npm create vite@latest application-name -- --template react-ts
```
